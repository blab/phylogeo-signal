## Contact data 
Stored in the ```contact_data/``` folder.

In this analysis, we used synthetic contact data generated by [Mistry et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20544-y) for Washington state (WA), USA. 
These data were downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mobs-lab/mixing-patterns) associated with their manuscript.
To estimate the number of contacts occurring between age groups (in decades) of the populations, we needed:
- the overall contact matrix ([United_States_subnational_Washington_M_overall_contact_matrix_85.csv](https://github.com/blab/phylo-kernel-public/blob/main/data/contact_data/United_States_subnational_Washington_M_overall_contact_matrix_85.csv))
- the age distribution of the WA population ([United_States_subnational_Washington_age_distribution_85.csv](https://github.com/blab/phylo-kernel-public/blob/main/data/contact_data/United_States_subnational_Washington_age_distribution_85.csv))

When re-using these estimates, please refer to [Mistry et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20544-y) and associated [repository](https://github.com/mobs-lab/mixing-patterns).


## Mobile-phone derived mobility data 
Stored in the ```mobility_data/``` folder.

We used mobile phone derived mobility data from the *SafeGraph* company to estimate the probability for a movement to occur within the same geographical unit.
We rely on two complementary datasets to perform this analysis.

### 1. Movement matrices from Pullano et al
[Pullano et al.](https://doi.org/10.2196/64914) provide estimates representing the daily mean connectivity network between US counties, aggregated at a monthly level during 2020.
These data were downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GiuliaPullano/US-Connectivity-Metapop) associated with their manuscript.
To estimate the probability for a movement to occur within the same county and within the same state, we used:
- the connectivity matrix for January 2020 [monthly_matrix_sd_county_month1..txt](https://github.com/GiuliaPullano/US-Connectivity-Metapop/blob/main/data/US_connectivity_network_2020_county/monthly_matrix_sd_county_month1..txt)
- a file linking the IDs used for counties in the connectivity matrix to corresponding FIPS codes [counties_fips_index.csv](https://github.com/GiuliaPullano/US-Connectivity-Metapop/blob/main/data/counties_fips_index.csv)


If re-using these estimates, please refer to [Pullano et al.](https://doi.org/10.2196/64914) and associated [repository](https://github.com/GiuliaPullano/US-Connectivity-Metapop). 

### 2. Finer-grainer mobility flows between WA geographies
